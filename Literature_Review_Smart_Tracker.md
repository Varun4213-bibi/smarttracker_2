# Literature Survey – Smart Tracker: Intelligent Expiry Date Management System

## 1. Introduction

Smart inventory management systems aim to track expiry dates of perishable goods, medications, and products to minimize waste, ensure safety, and optimize consumption. Traditional manual tracking methods often lead to expired items being overlooked, resulting in financial losses, health risks, and environmental impact.

Modern Smart Tracker systems provide automated expiry monitoring, intelligent notifications, OCR-based date extraction, barcode integration, and cross-platform accessibility. These systems leverage mobile applications, web interfaces, and AI-powered features to help users manage their inventory efficiently.

Research in smart tracking systems focuses on:
• Automated expiry detection and notifications
• OCR and computer vision for date extraction
• Barcode and QR code integration
• Mobile-first inventory management
• Waste reduction and sustainability
• Offline functionality and PWA capabilities
• Donation and redistribution systems
• AI-assisted inventory optimization

These studies provide the foundation for systems like Smart Tracker, an intelligent multi-platform expiry management platform.

## 3. Analysis and Synthesis

### Current State of Research
The literature reveals a growing focus on technology-driven solutions for expiry management and waste reduction. Key trends include:

**Mobile-First Approach**: Studies consistently show that mobile applications are the most effective platform for expiry tracking due to their accessibility and notification capabilities.

**AI and Computer Vision**: OCR and computer vision technologies have matured significantly, enabling automated date extraction from product packaging.

**Multi-Modal Integration**: Successful systems combine barcode scanning, manual entry, OCR, and AI predictions for comprehensive inventory management.

**Behavioral Impact**: Research indicates that smart tracking systems not only provide technical solutions but also influence user behavior toward better inventory management.

### Gaps and Opportunities
While significant progress has been made, several areas require further research:

**Cross-Platform Synchronization**: Limited studies on seamless data synchronization between web and mobile platforms.

**Predictive Analytics**: Few systems incorporate AI for consumption prediction and optimal purchasing recommendations.

**Social Impact Integration**: Limited research on connecting expiry tracking with donation and redistribution systems.

**Offline Functionality**: While PWA capabilities exist, comprehensive offline inventory management needs more exploration.

### Relevance to Smart Tracker
The Smart Tracker system addresses many of the identified gaps by providing:
- Cross-platform synchronization (Web + Mobile)
- Advanced OCR and barcode integration
- AI-assisted inventory management
- Donation system integration
- Offline PWA capabilities
- Multi-modal data entry (manual, OCR, barcode)
